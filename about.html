        Flip-in is a simple memory game where you need to find matching pairs of
        cards. <br />Each card has a picture on it and you need to turn over two
        cards to see if they match. <br />If they do, you can keep them flipped
        over. If they don't, the cards will turn back over. <br />The goal is to
        find all the matching pairs before time runs out.
